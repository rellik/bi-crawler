# bi-crawler

A script built in Java! not too much Domain modelling going on. 

To run you can run the main in App passing domain "http://wiprodigital.com" as the argument.

Output of the links are to a file named bi-crawler.output in the working directory.

Some tests to verify a subset of urls. 

Assumptions:

1. Its single threaded since parallelising would need more sophisticated solutions. Also gives adequate time to hit servers repeatedly safeley

2. Have not supported IP address for domain.


With more time: 
1. Can parallelise and make it faster.
